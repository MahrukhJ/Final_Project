I think it would be interesting to investigate the relationship between income and life expectancy and 
examining the factors that can lead to an increase or decrease in life expectancy.
'Introduction:'
Life expectancy has increased significantly over the past centuries. This paper will study the impact of 
income inequality on life expectancy along with observing other variables that may play a significant factor. 

One of the first studies that established a relationship between income inequality and life expectancy 
measured the level, temporal trend, and geographical variability in the association between income and 
life expectancy while identifying factors related to small area variation within the association. 
After evaluating factors associated with differences in life expectancy and estimating said expectancy by 
household income percentile, sex & geographic area, the study found that higher income was associated with 
higher life expectancy throughout the income distribution.
  
'Literature Review:'
A notable study that established the relationship between income and life expectancy written in 2016 by Chetty et al., 
The Association Between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001 â€“ 2014, measured the level, temporal trend, 
and geographical variability in the association between income and life expectancy while identifying factors related to 
small area variation within the association. Income data for the U.S. population was obtained from 1.4 billion de-identified
tax records from 1999-2014; mortality data obtained through the Social Security Administration death records. With the objective 
of evaluating factors associated with differences in life expectancy and estimating said expectancy by household income percentile, 
sex & geographic area, the study found that higher income was associated with higher life expectancy throughout the income distribution. 
Inequality in life expectancy increased over time, life expectancy for low-income individuals was positively correlated with the local 
area fraction of immigrants, college graduates & local government expenditures and geographic differences in life expectancy for 
individuals in the lowest income quartile were significantly correlated with smoking but not significantly correlated with access to 
medical care, labor market conditions or income inequality. 

'Data:'

Analyzing the table that depicts income across education levels leads to the observation that as a persons level of education attained increases, 
the larger the number of people who earn $75,000 or more, will be, for that category. Reasonably, higher education levels can lead to better 
occupations and a healthier lifestyle, which can contribute to longer life expectancy.
